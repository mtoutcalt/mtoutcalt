Prompt: 

I want you to fact check the article below in full. Leave no stone unturned. To do so, first, look at the text of the article and parse out each individual fact — after this, you should have a list of facts. Then, for each fact, do comprehensive research and use web search to determine whether it is true, false, or unclear. Aim for at least three independent, high quality and trustworthy sources for each fact.

Then, once you've done this for *every* fact, return a table with each fact and its corresponding results (including sources for each check).

Prompt: Act as an expert summarizer and critical reader. I’m going to share a long document or article with you — your job is to extract the key insights, break down complex points into simple language, and structure the summary so it’s easy to scan and understand. Start with a brief overview (2–3 sentences), followed by key takeaways as bullet points or sections (depending on the content). Highlight any data, trends, or powerful quotes worth remembering. If the document is biased, outdated, or missing context, let me know. At the end, suggest 1–2 thoughtful follow-up questions I could explore or ask someone if I were discussing this in a meeting. Assume I want to sound sharp without reading the whole thing.
