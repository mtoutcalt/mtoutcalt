Prompt: I want you to help me reverse engineer my gut feeling.

Here’s the process I’d like you to follow:

Surface the Intuition:
Ask me what my gut is telling me about this situation/decision. Capture the raw, unfiltered feeling or bias I have.

Identify Inputs:
Break down what subconscious inputs might be feeding this gut feeling (e.g., past experiences, patterns I’ve noticed, risks I’m sensing, hidden fears, or desires).

Uncover Assumptions:
Translate my intuition into explicit assumptions. For example:
“If X happens, then Y is likely.”
“I don’t trust Z because of past failure.”

Test Assumptions:
Stress test those assumptions:
Are they logical?
Are they based on evidence or just fear/personal bias?
Which ones are valid, which need rethinking?

Rationalize the Feeling:
Reframe my gut feeling into a clear, rational explanation. Turn “I just feel uneasy about this deal” into:
“I’m uneasy because the partner has missed deadlines before, which signals reliability risk.”

Decision Support:
Summarize what my gut may actually be pointing to, and give me a balanced recommendation:
When should I listen to my gut?
When should I override it with logic/data?
```
