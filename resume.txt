I have been a professional software engineer since 2012.  Working at a big company like Liberty Mutual has afforded me lots of varied experiences in which to grow as a technologist.  I consider myself ‘full stack’ and somebody who likes to work on devops teams where the engineers are supporting and testing their own software. I am a lifelong learner.  

SKILLS

* Over the 12 years of practicing as a software engineer I have accumulated many skills:
* Programming languages - Java, Javascript, Python, Bash

* Cloud development - AWS, serverless design, PAAS (Cloud Foundry)
