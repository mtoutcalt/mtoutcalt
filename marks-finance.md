* use high-yield savings accounts - regular savings accounts interest rate is complete dogshit
* max out 401k and HSA
* AI bubble - sell the big tech stocks, sell some of the ETS where the big 10 are big percentage - dont get out of the market yet - buy more boring funds, more international - europe/japan/nordic/india/china ETFS
* crypto - stick with bitcoin and ethereum - high risk/high reward - maybe 1% only?  gambling money, what you can lose
* try to retire by 55 - realize that you can retire too late and your money grows faster than your smaller cost-of-living, that would be dumb to wait to retire
* get the big stuff right - below your means for housing/transportation - stick to public school when you can - take care of your physical/mental health to mitigate health expenses - focus on making more income --> then you can live a sweet life where you don't sweat the small pleasures - like starbucks/books/videogames etc..
